Repository Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo, separating frontend and backend into dedicated folders.

This structure is chosen to make the assignment easy to review and run locally in a single repository.

In a real production environment, frontend and backend services would typically be maintained in separate repositories, allowing:

Independent CI/CD pipelines

Clear ownership between teams

Independent deployment and scaling

For the purpose of this test, a monorepo provides better clarity and convenience.
